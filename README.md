## What is Amidstest?

Amidstest is Amidst converted to support [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) â€” a completely free and open implementation of Minecraft-like games, and a mod paradise.

Amidstest is a tool to display a map of a world (either Minetest or Minecraft), without actually creating it.

With Minetest worlds, it can:

* render an overview of a world from a given seed and mapgen version
* apply different biome sets to the world
* locate biomes
* view biomes as Voronoi diagrams (to aid designing/tuning biomes)
* calculate biome coverage of worlds
* save images of the map


The following has not *yet* been implemented for Minetest worlds:
* display dungeon locations
* locate and load any non-default advanced mapgen parameters you might be tweaking
* Player locations, and exact spawn location.

Amidst **cannot**:

* display changes that were applied to a save game like
  * changes made by world editors like MCEdit
  * changes made while loading the world in Minecraft

## Amidst has found a new home

Amidst was moved to a new location, since Skidoodle aka skiphs is to busy to maintain it. It has also found some new developers. One of them is DrFrankenstone aka Treer who is the developer of AmidstExporter. Skidoodle is still an owner of Amidst and agreed to move the project.
